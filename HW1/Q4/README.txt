This directory contains all of the codes from Q3 with some minor changes. Plus, it also has a new script called "watcher.py" which looks for the changes in the topology every 5 seconds.
This script would change the weight matrix, calculates the new shortest path, creates the new flows and finally pushes them to the controller.

There are also two files "Q4_mininet_script" and "Q4_watcher_script" which contain the mininet test and the equivalent watcher logs in them.
